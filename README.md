## Hello - I am Alys üëã

I am a quantitative ecology researcher passionate about conserving biodiversity. I employ quantitative tools and data-driven approaches to understand and protect ecosystems and species at broad spatial scales. 
 
I work as a Research Fellow with the [Global Ecology Lab](https://www.globalecologylab.org/) at [James Cook University](https://www.jcu.edu.au/) and am a PhD candidate with the [Conservation Science lab](https://conservationscience.org.au/) and [Planet A lab](https://www.planet-a.earth/) at [Deakin University](https://www.deakin.edu.au/). My PhD thesis examined how to bring together data and knowledges from global to local scales for conservation on Indigenous lands in Australia.

I also work as a Research Assistant with [ACEFA](https://acefa-hubs.github.io/) at [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/). Previously, I worked as a research assistant at [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au/en/) to [understand antimicrobial resistance](https://research.csiro.au/amr-hotspots/). My research focuses on biogeography, ecology, and remote sensing, often using large datasets. I have a Bachelor of Science (Zoology) and Master of Science (BioSciences) from The University of Melbourne.

üî≠ My work spans a range of biodiversity issues and quantitative approaches, including:

- Identifying critical refuge for threatened species ([see publication](https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/acv.12763))
- Developing species distribution models to support shoreline restoration ([see publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352485523000464) and [shiny app](https://livingshorelines.shinyapps.io/VicMap/))
- Investigating trends in animal populations in central Australia ([see related publication](https://www.publish.csiro.au/wr/WR24070) and [shiny app](https://aridzonemonitoring.org.au/))
- Advancing the development of ecosystem information ([see preprint](https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/view/7654/))
- Testing quantitative approaches to ecosystem mapping ([see preprint](https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/view/8500/))
- Applying Bayesian spatial models to health research ([see preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.06.24316846v1))

I am most comfortable coding in R. I often use large spatial datasets. I am passionate about working with local and Indigenous peoples to support their goals and aspirations in managing biodiversity. I strive to create supportive, approachable, and collaborative environments wherever I work. I also enjoy sharing my knowledge through teaching coding and collaborating on interdisciplinary research.

Outside of research, you‚Äôll likely find me rock climbing/bouldering, playing softball, or gardening.
