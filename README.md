## Hello - I am Alys üëã

I am a researcher passionate about conserving biodiversity. I employ quantitative tools and data-driven approaches to understand and protect ecosystems and species at broad spatial scales. 
 
I work as a Research Fellow with the [Global Ecology Lab](https://www.globalecologylab.org/) at at [James Cook University](https://www.jcu.edu.au/) and am a PhD candidate with the [Conservation Science lab](https://conservationscience.org.au/) at [Deakin University](https://www.deakin.edu.au/). I also work as a Research Assistant with [ACEFA](https://acefa-hubs.github.io/) at [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/). My research focuses on the biogeography, ecology, and remote sensing, often using large spatial datasets.

üî≠ My work spans a range of biodiversity and conservation issues, including:

- Identifying critical locations for threatened species breeding ([see publication](https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/acv.12763))
- Developing species distribution models to support shoreline restoration ([see publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352485523000464))
- Advancing the development of ecosystem information ([see preprint](https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/view/7654/))
- Testing quantitative approaches to ecosystem mapping ([see preprint](https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/view/8500/))
- Applying Bayesian spatial models to health research ([see preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.06.24316846v1))

I am most comfortable coding in R. I strive to create supportive, approachable, and collaborative environments wherever I work. I also enjoy sharing my knowledge through teaching coding and collaborating on interdisciplinary research.

Outside of research, you‚Äôll likely find me rock climbing/bouldering, playing softball, or gardening.
